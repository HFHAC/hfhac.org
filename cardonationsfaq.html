                     <p><b>Cars for Homes</b> is Habitat for Humanity’s
                     national car donation program. The program is staffed by
                     full-time Habitat for Humanity employees who monitor and
                     manage all activities undertaken by Advanced Remarketing
                     Services, Inc. Proceeds from all sales through Cars for
                     Homes go to your local Habitat for Humanity affiliate.</p>

                     <p><b>Advanced Remarketing Services, Inc.</b> is Habitat’s
                     authorized national agent that processes all vehicle
                     donations to Habitat for Humanity. ARS handles title
                     transfer, towing and reporting of all vehicle donations.
                     ARS accepts vehicle donations online through
                     CarDonationWizard.com and via their call center at

                     <p><b>How does the Cars for Homes vehicle donation process
                     work?</b> Read how the process works <a href=
                     "cardonationshowtheywork.html"><b>here</b></a></p>

                     <p><b>What kinds of vehicles can be donated?</b><br>
                     Cars Trucks Motorcycles Recreational vehicles Snowmobiles
                     Farm equipment Construction equipment Boats Airplanes</p>

                     <p><b>What if the vehicle is not running?</b> Cars for
                     Homes accepts any vehicle as long as it is whole and has
                     four inflated tires (so it can be moved by our towing
                     operators). In rare cases, Cars for Homes may be unable to
                     accept a vehicle if the cost of transport and processing
                     fees would exceed the auction value of the vehicle.</p>

                     <p><b>How long will it take to have my vehicle picked
                     up?</b> Donated vehicles are typically picked up within
                     two or three days after the title is received by our
                     processing center. You can speed up the donation process
                     by providing information and downloading documents online.
                     Special arrangements can be made whenever car donations
                     must be made more quickly.</p>

                     <p><b>What documents do I need to donate a car?</b> Most
                     states require a clear title to the vehicle, and some
                     states also require a notarized signature or additional
                     forms to complete a vehicle donation. If you cannot locate
                     or have lost the certificate of title, we can help you
                     obtain the proper documentation and forms.</p>

                     <p><b>What if the vehicle is not registered in my
                     name?</b> The vehicle does not need to be registered in
                     your name. The name on the title may often differ from the
                     name on the registration documents. Call Cars for Homes at
                     877-277-4344 for more information.</p>

                     <p><b>How do I know my vehicle is in good hands once it’s
                     been picked up?</b> Habitat for Humanity uses a licensed
                     and insured national transportation network and complies
                     with all federal and state regulations. By signing the
                     title directly to Advanced Remarketing Services, you are
                     legally transferring ownership of your vehicle to Habitat
                     for Humanity. When your title is received and your vehicle
                     is picked up, you are no longer responsible for the
                     vehicle.</p>

                     <p><b>How much of the money generated by the sale of my
                     car donation goes to Habitat for Humanity?</b> On a
                     monthly basis, Advanced Remarketing Services returns over
                     80 percent of the gross revenue generated from vehicle
                     sales to Cars for Homes. This percentage is more than any
                     other vehicle processing entity.</p>

                     <p><b>What are the tax benefits of donating my car to
                     Habitat for Humanity?</b> Read more here: Tax benefits of
                     your car donation.</p>
