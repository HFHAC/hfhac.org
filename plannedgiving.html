                     <p>When you think of planned giving, you may think you
                     have to win the lottery or be wealthy to make a large gift
                     to Habitat. But that’s not the case. In fact, planned
                     giving is simple technique that can enable anyone to
                     increase the impact of their support for Habitat and
                     receive tax benefits at the same time.</p>

                     <p>On some level, all gifts are planned. Most of us take
                     some time to carefully think about what we want to
                     support, how much we can afford to contribute, and how our
                     money will be used. That’s planning! By thinking about the
                     possibility of helping Habitat with its mission to provide
                     simple, decent homes for God’s people in need now, you
                     will be able to enjoy knowing that your planning will
                     assure that our mission will continue to be met for years
                     to come.</p>

                     <p>Some of the most popular methods of planned giving are
                     outlined in this section. Please consider this information
                     a starting point. The effective planned gifts are made in
                     coordination with an estate plan. To provide the most
                     benefit to Habitat for Humanity of Anderson County, please
                     consult with an attorney and tax advisor prior to making
                     any planned gifts.</p>
