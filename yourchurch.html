                     <p>Habitat for Humanity was created to demonstrate the
                     love and teachings of Jesus Christ, and we welcome people
                     from all walks of life to share in our mission. It is only
                     natural that the church should be a primary partner in
                     Habitat’s work.</p>

                     <p>There are as many ways to get involved with the
                     ministry of Habitat as there are different God-given
                     talents in each of us. Here are just a few ways your
                     congregation can help:</p>

                     <p><b>Pray, pray, pray!</b> Include the ministry of Habitat in
                     your prayers. “The prayer of the righteous is powerful and
                     effective.” - James 5:16</p>

                     <p><b>Help out with a house building construction project.</b>
                     These can range from taking part in construction, planting
                     trees and gardens, painting, providing lunch, being a crew
                     chief, and many more responsibilities. “We should use
                     whatever gift we have received to serve others, faithfully
                     administering God's grace in its various forms.” – I Peter
                     4:10</p>

                     <p><b>Volunteer at the Habitat office or in the Habitat
                     ReStore</b> doing any number of helpful activities such as
                     customer service, stocking inventory, clerical work, and
                     picking up donated items. “Since we have gifts that differ
                     according to the grace given to us, each of us is to
                     exercise them accordingly” – Romans 12:6</p>

                     <p><b>Contribute financially</b> – Make a personal donation or
                     take up a special offering in your Sunday School class or
                     worship service. “The righteous give without sparing.” -
                     Proverbs 21:26</p>

                     <p><b>Motivate your church to sponsor a house</b> – This is the
                     biggest and most tangible way for you and your church to
                     make an impact in the community for the kingdom of God.
                     Make a commitment of time, energy, finances, and love, and
                     become a sponsor congregation or partner with other
                     churches to sponsor building a house for a family in need.
                     “I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you
                     gave me drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in… In
                     as much as you did for the least of these, you did for
                     me.” – Matthew 25:35, 40</p><br>
