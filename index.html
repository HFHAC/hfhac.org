			<p>Habitat for Humanity International and its affiliated organizations (HFH) will not proselytize. Nor will HFH work with entities or individuals who insist on proselytizing as part of their work with HFH. This means that HFH will not offer assistance on the expressed or implied condition that people must (1) adhere to or convert to a particular faith or (2) listen and respond to messaging designed to induce conversion to a particular faith.</p>
