                     <p>Our diverse volunteer program enables everyone to play
                     a role in increasing decent and affordable housing in
                     Anderson County. Volunteers are the backbone, heart and
                     soul, hands and feet of Habitat whether they wield a
                     hammer, pen, or a keyboard! We welcome people of all ages,
                     races, religions, abilities, and backgrounds to partner
                     with us to fulfill our goal of eliminating poverty
                     housing.</p>

                     <p>Habitat for Humanity of Anderson County is an
                     organization of great diversity. Building a house is a
                     task that takes many hands and many hearts to build. While
                     working alongside family members at the construction site
                     is one of our most popular volunteer opportunities, there
                     are many other ways you can be a part of our mission.
                     Below are a few examples of how you might put your special
                     skills to work helping to build simple, decent
                     housing.</p>

                     <p>Do you have a special skill or talent? Or do you have a
                     professional skill that might be helpful? Let us know, as
                     there may be other ways you can volunteer.<br>

                     <p><b>Ways You Can Share Your Special Skills</b></p>

                     <p><b>Construction Volunteers</b> All skill levels are
                     welcome to help build. There is a group of volunteers that
                     work during the week that would love to have you join
                     them. This group usually works Tuesday through Friday on
                     whatever build or repair projects we are currently working
                     on. While we do hire subcontractors such as electricians
                     and plumbers, the volunteer group does the framing,
                     insulation, flooring, roofing, etc. On Saturdays,
                     additional volunteers, usually provided by churches or
                     businesses that have sponsored a build or repair project,
                     do more unskilled work such as painting and yard work.</p>

                     <p><b>ReStore Cashiers</b> The Habitat ReStore is in great
                     need of volunteer cashiers. Tasks primarily focus on
                     ringing up customers and assisting with customer service.
                     People skills and basic computer skills are a must, and a
                     list of references is required. Training will be provided.
                     Volunteers are asked to commit to a 4 hour period 1 to 4
                     times a month.<br></p>

                     <p><b>ReStore Volunteers</b> Do you enjoy collectibles,
                     antiques, the rare find, books, and other small treasures?
                     If so, the Habitat ReStore is the volunteer place for you.
                     The store is currently seeking volunteers to help with
                     customer service, stocking, and donation pick-ups. Habitat
                     ReStore volunteers receive a 10% discount in the store,
                     and the added benefit of seeing items when they first come
                     in!</p>

                     <p><b>Hospitality Volunteers</b> Share your knack for
                     Southern hospitality by helping to accommodate visiting
                     volunteer groups. Throughout the year, we tend to host
                     15-20 groups of students who spend their school breaks
                     volunteering with Habitat. During their stay, we work to
                     provide them with housing and food to maximize their
                     Habitat experience.</p>

                     <p><b>Data Entry</b> Must be detailed, have intermediate
                     to advanced computer skills, and previous database
                     experience preferred. Training is provided.</p>

                     <p><b>Mailings</b> Duties include folding paper,
                     stuffing/sealing/addressing envelopes, and other
                     miscellaneous tasks related to mailing large quantities of
                     mail. Training is provided.</p>

                     <p><b>Linguists</b> Fluent in another language? Help us
                     reach out to more families in need by helping to translate
                     our program information into another language.</p>

                     <p><b>Website Manager</b> This website was written during
                     the fall of 2014 using HTML5 and CSS. If you are
                     knowledgeable about websites, Habitat needs you! Simple
                     maintenance is all that is really needed.</p>

                     <p><b>Photographers</b> They say a picture is worth a
                     thousand words, but volunteers with strong photography
                     skills are priceless. If you are a professional with a
                     little extra time on your hands or a semi-pro looking to
                     expand your portfolio, let us know. Photographs are a
                     powerful way to share the Habitat mission and you can be a
                     part of that opportunity.</p><br>

                     <p><b>Online Training:</b><br>
                     Volunteers are encouraged to participate in an online
                     safety training course through Habitat for Humanity
                     International and Lockton Insurance. Here's how:<br>
                     <br>
                     <b>1.</b> Go to <a href=
                     "http://www.hfhvolunteerinsurance.com"><b>hfhvolunteerinsurance.com</b></a><br>

                     <b>2.</b> Once there, click on Step 1, on right hand side,
                     to READ the course instructions. An access code is
                     necessary to take the training course, which is on the
                     course instructions page.<br>
                     <b>3.</b> Return to the main page and click on Step 2 to
                     TAKE the course. At the screen that opens, enter the
                     Access Code in the box and click submit.<br>
                     <b>4.</b> At the Safety Course list screen, select the
                     recommended course: Volunteering On A Habitat for Humanity
                     Job Site.<br>
                     5. The course will load and start automatically. Follow
                     along with the presentation. At the end there will be a
                     10-question quiz. Proceed with taking the quiz. If you
                     pass (score 70% or better), we will receive a completion
                     certificate certifying you have completed the course. You
                     may request a copy from us, if you choose. If you do not
                     score a 70% or higher the first time, you can take the
                     course again.</p><br>
