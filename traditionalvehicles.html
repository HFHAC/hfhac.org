                     <p><b>Cash</b><br>
                     Nothing could be easier than making a gift of cash to
                     Habitat for Humanity. It is the most common gift and the
                     one you probably think of first. All cash donations are
                     deductible, if you itemize in the year of contribution, up
                     to 50 percent of your adjusted gross income. Any excess
                     deductions can be carried forward for the next five years.
                     You can make year-end gifts, or make a gift in memory or
                     honor of a friend or loved one, perhaps on the occasion of
                     a birthday, graduation, anniversary or other special day.
                     It is the perfect gift for someone who has everything.</p>

                     <p><b>Life Insurance</b><br>
                     Do you have life insurance policies that are no longer
                     needed? You may either donate the life insurance policy to
                     us, or simply name us as the beneficiary.</p>

                     <p><b>Bequests</b><br>
                     Have you made provisions in your will to benefit us?
                     Bequests are the most popular type of planned gifts.
                     Anything you leave to Habitat for Humanity will reduce the
                     size of your taxable estate while helping a good cause.
                     You can leave to us a specific bequest of a specified sum
                     of money or a particular piece of property. Other options
                     are to leave a percentage of your estate or a percentage
                     of the residue to us after making provisions for family
                     and friends. For instance, you could leave us a specific
                     bequest of $10,000, or you could leave us 10 percent of
                     the residue of your estate.</p>

                     <p><b>Securities</b><br>
                     Stocks and publicly traded securities are easy to give and
                     offer great tax advantages. The best stocks to use for
                     charitable giving are those that have increased greatly in
                     value, particularly those producing a low yield. If you
                     have held them for more than one year, you will pay no
                     capital gains tax on this transaction, and you can deduct
                     the full fair market value.</p>

                     <p><b>Bank Accounts and CDs</b><br>
                     Are you aware that you can name us as the
                     "payable-on-death beneficiary" of your bank accounts or on
                     certificates of deposit? You own the assets for your
                     lifetime and have them available for your use. Upon your
                     death, the assets pass directly to us without going
                     through probate. Simply visit your bank and request the
                     necessary forms to name a beneficiary on your accounts or
                     CDs. You can change beneficiary designations at any
                     time.</p>

                     <p><b>Retirement Plan</b><br>
                     Assets Because our tax laws often subject retirement plan
                     assets to the highest combined income and estate taxes,
                     charitable donations of these assets may be the most
                     efficient estate planning option. Many of the techniques
                     discussed in this brochure can be used to create generous
                     charitable gifts, usually at your death, from retirement
                     plan assets that could otherwise be subject to tax rates
                     of nearly 65 percent. At the same time, you can pass more
                     tax-favored assets to your family. Because of the variety
                     and complexity of retirement plans, you should consult an
                     attorney or tax specialist for a strategy best suited to
                     your situation.</p><br>
