                     <p><b>Real Estate</b><br>
                     A gift of real estate offers you the opportunity to make a
                     significant charitable contribution with a tax-friendly
                     outcome. There are several ways to donate real estate
                     depending on your situation.</p>

                     <p><b>Outright Gift</b><br>
                     An outright gift may be the simplest solution if you own
                     property that is not mortgaged, has appreciated in value
                     and that you no longer need or use, such as a second home
                     or vacation property. You can deduct the fair market value
                     of your gift and avoid all capital gains taxes. Plus, you
                     no longer have to worry about the costs of continued
                     ownership, and you have removed that asset from your
                     taxable estate.</p>

                     <p><b>Retained Life Estate</b><br>
                     Did you know that you can transfer the deed of your
                     personal residence or farm to us now and keep the right to
                     use the property for your lifetime and that of your
                     spouse? You will receive a current charitable deduction in
                     an amount that is based upon your and your spouse's life
                     expectancy and the value of the property.</p>

                     <p><b>Bargain Sale</b><br>
                     A bargain sale can generate a gift that is less than the
                     full fair market value of the property. In this scenario
                     you agree to sell the property to a charitable
                     organization at less than its fair market value. The
                     difference between the sale price and the fair market
                     value is your charitable deduction. While the tax rules
                     relating to a bargain sale are somewhat complex, the net
                     result is often more favorable than selling the property
                     at fair market value and making a charitable contribution
                     from the realized capital gain.</p>
