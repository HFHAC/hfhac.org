                     <p><b>Gifts that Give Back to You</b></p>

                     <p>There are several ways you can make a significant
                     future gift to us while retaining, or in many cases
                     increasing, the income you receive from the asset. Because
                     you receive income in return for your gift, your
                     charitable deduction is limited to the portion of the gift
                     that will ultimately pass to Habitat for Humanity. We
                     would be happy to discuss any of these methods with you in
                     more detail or share sample illustrations of how a life
                     income gift can benefit you first, then eventually us.</p>

                     <p><b>Charitable Gift Annuity</b><br>
                     This is a simple contract between you and a charitable
                     organization that pays you a fixed dollar amount (an
                     annuity) for your lifetime and that of another individual,
                     if desired, based upon your age(s) at the time of your
                     gift. The older you are, the higher the annuity. If you
                     use appreciated property to fund the gift annuity, you
                     will escape the capital gains tax on the gift portion of
                     the transaction and the remaining gain will be apportioned
                     over your lifetime. This is a wonderful way to increase
                     income from stocks that pay small dividends and carry
                     heavy capital gains.</p>

                     <p><b>Charitable Remainder Trust</b><br>
                     A charitable remainder trust is a trust that will pay the
                     donor (and one or more other named beneficiaries, if
                     desired) a fixed or variable income depending on the type
                     of trust selected. The payments are made either for life
                     or a period of time not to exceed 20 years. The annual
                     payments cannot be less than 5 percent of the initial fair
                     market value of the trust. At the end of the trust's term,
                     the balance in the trust helps support our mission.</p>

                     <p><b>Charitable Lead Trust</b><br>
                     This type of charitable trust pays income to one or more
                     charitable organizations, typically for a period of years,
                     and then the remaining assets of the trust pass to
                     noncharitable beneficiaries, such as family members. While
                     this type of trust usually does not provide a current
                     income tax deduction, it can effectively pass property to
                     family members at reduced estate and gift tax costs.</p>
