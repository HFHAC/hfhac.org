                     <p><b>Shop the Habitat ReStore</b><br>
                     The Habitat ReStore is a resale store that accepts
                     donations of new and gently used home furnishings,
                     building supplies, and other household items. Those items
                     are then sold to the public at a fraction of the normal
                     retail price. All proceeds go back to helping build
                     simple, decent houses. Learn more about the ReStore

                     <p><b>House Sponsorships</b><br>
                     Sponsoring a house with Habitat for Humanity of Anderson
                     County is an investment that has the power to build a
                     stronger community. Sponsorship not only helps a family in
                     need of decent and affordable housing, but it also makes a
